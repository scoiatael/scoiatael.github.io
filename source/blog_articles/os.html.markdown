Various rather small programs covering different aspects of developing applications for modern operating systems -- with heavy focus on Linux programming.

We began with rather small programs -- covering mostly inspecting OS state and specific behaviour. Link: [1st part](http://www.github.io/scoiatael/OpSysProgramming)

Then we focused on concurrent applications: usage of threads, fork, process communication and thread synchronization. Link: [2nd part](http://www.github.io/scoiatael/OpSysProgramming2)

Finally we delved into advanced OS tasks: file systems, dynamic and static linking, memory protection and allocation. Link: [3rd part](http://www.github.io/scoiatael/OpSysProgramming3)
